## By V.S.Sai Rashwant(20BCE1332) & B.ARUN PRASATH(20BRS1080) <br />
	
Application Design: <br />
	We are making a stopwatch application using react native expo. <br />
	We have 5 components. <br />
		Control <br />
		Header <br />
		Result <br />
		Stopwatch <br />
		Utility <br />
We divided whole app into 5 components. <br />
Control: This component defines how the buttons will work when the clock is running and when the clock is not not running. <br />
Header: This component defines how the Stop watch logo will look. <br />
Result: This component takes care of calculating how the clock should run and how the result has to be calculated. <br />
Stopwatch: This component combines everyother component, and uses it develor the ui of the stopwatch app. <br />
Utility: This defines on how the numbers should display on the screen. <br />
