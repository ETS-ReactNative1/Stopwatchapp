# Stopwatch app
## By V.S.Sai Rashwant(20BCE1332) & B.ARUN PRASATH(20BRS1080)
	
Application Design:
	We are making a stopwatch application using react native expo.
	We have 5 components.
		Control
		Header
		Result
		Stopwatch
		Utility
We divided whole app into 5 components.
Control: This component defines how the buttons will work when the clock is running and when the clock is not not running.
Header: This component defines how the Stop watch logo will look
Result: This component takes care of calculating how the clock should run and how the result has to be calculated.
Stopwatch: This component combines everyother component, and uses it develor the ui of the stopwatch app.
Utility: This defines on how the numbers should display on the screen.
